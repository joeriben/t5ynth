# T5ynth Architecture

Code-level walkthrough for C++/JUCE developers new to the project. This document
describes *where code lives* and *how the C++ layers are wired together*. It
deliberately does **not** cover the audio signal flow — that is documented in
`resources/T5ynth_Guide.html`, section 16 ("Signal flow reference"), which is
shipped as `BinaryData::T5ynth_Guide_html` and reachable from the plugin's
`Manual` button.

For sibling docs written alongside this one, see the cross-reference list at
the end.

### `src/` subtree

- **`src/PluginProcessor.{h,cpp}`** — root of the plugin, see §2.
- **`src/PluginEditor.{h,cpp}`** — 31 lines total. Installs the custom
  `T5ynthLookAndFeel`, instantiates a `MainPanel`, sets window size
  `1300×867` with a `3:2` fixed aspect ratio. Real UI lives in `gui/`.
- **`src/dsp/`** — per-voice and global DSP classes. Notable entries:
  - `SynthVoice.{h,cpp}` — single monophonic voice; owns its `WavetableOscillator`,
    `SamplePlayer`, three `ADSREnvelope`s (amp + 2 mod), two per-voice `LFO`s,
    `NoiseGenerator`, and `StateVariableFilter` (`T5ynthFilter`).
    See `src/dsp/SynthVoice.h:17`.
  - `VoiceManager.{h,cpp}` — fixed `std::array<SynthVoice, 16>` pool with
    runtime `voiceLimit` (1/4/6/8/12/16) and oldest-note stealing.
    See `src/dsp/VoiceManager.h:14`.
  - `WavetableOscillator`, `SamplePlayer`, `WavetableBank` — the two
    oscillator types fed by the generator output. Both are owned by
    `T5ynthProcessor` as *master* instances (`masterOsc`, `masterSampler`) and
    the per-voice copies share frame/buffer data.
  - `LFO`, `DriftLFO`, `ADSREnvelope`, `StateVariableFilter`,
    `NoiseGenerator`.
  - `DelayLine`, `ConvolutionReverb`, `AlgorithmicReverb`, `Limiter` —
    global post-sum effects.
  - `BlockParams.h` — plain-old-data struct carrying every per-block
    parameter value from APVTS down into `VoiceManager::renderBlock`.
  - `ModulationMatrix.{h,cpp}` — **stub**, see §5.
- **`src/gui/`** — every `juce::Component` subclass, plus `T5ynthLookAndFeel`
  and `GuiHelpers.h` (shared `SliderRow`, `SwitchBox` primitives). See §3.
- **`src/inference/`** — `PipeInference.{h,cpp}` only. C++ side of the IPC to
  Python. See §6.
- **`src/sequencer/`** — `StepSequencer`, `Arpeggiator`,
  `GenerativeSequencer` (Euclidean + scale-quantized note generator).
  Driven from `processBlock` and exposed via `PluginProcessor` accessors.
- **`src/presets/PresetFormat.{h,cpp}`** — .t5p binary serialization with
  embedded audio. Magic `T5YN`, current version `2`. See
  `src/presets/PresetFormat.h:8` and `docs/PRESET_FORMAT.md` for the
  wire format.

---

## 2. Plugin lifecycle orchestration

`T5ynthProcessor` (`src/PluginProcessor.h:17`) is the root object owned by the
host (DAW or standalone wrapper). It owns everything with lifetime bound to
the plugin instance:

- the `juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState parameters` tree, built in
  `createParameterLayout()` (`src/PluginProcessor.cpp:19` — returns at line
  467);
- the DSP pipeline (`voiceManager`, `masterOsc`, `masterSampler`, two global
  `LFO`s, `driftLfo`, `postFilter`, `delay`, `reverb`, `algoReverb`,
  `limiter`);
- the three sequencers (`stepSequencer`, `generativeSequencer`, `arpeggiator`);
- the `PipeInference pipeInference` client that manages the Python
  subprocess;
- generated-audio buffers (`generatedAudioFull`, `generatedAudioRaw`) plus
  the last known `sampleRate`, seed, prompts, and prompt embeddings —
  these are *GUI-visible state that is not in APVTS*. See §7.

### APVTS as single source of truth

`createParameterLayout()` is the only place where APVTS parameters are
registered. Every exposed control in the GUI ultimately resolves to an
`AudioProcessorValueTreeState::SliderAttachment`, `ButtonAttachment`, or
`ComboBoxAttachment` against an ID declared here. When adding a new
parameter you touch three places: this function, the DSP class that reads
it (typically via `BlockParams` populated in `processBlock`), and the panel
that exposes it.

### `prepareToPlay`

`src/PluginProcessor.cpp:470`. Calls `prepare(sampleRate, samplesPerBlock)`
on every DSP member, loads the default convolution-reverb IR from
`BinaryData::emt_140_plate_medium_wav` (§8), resizes pre-allocated scratch
buffers (`lfo1Buffer`, `lfo2Buffer`, `reverbSendBuffer`), and computes
`tailBlocks` for deep-idle detection (≈10 seconds of reverb tail at the
current block size).

### `processBlock`

`src/PluginProcessor.cpp:505`. High-level structure:

1. **Idle gating.** Track `silentBlockCount` — once no voices are active
   and no MIDI has arrived for `tailBlocks` blocks, skip the entire body
   and just advance LFO phases (`audioIdle` becomes `true`).
2. **Voice count update.** Read `voice_count` choice and resize the
   active pool.
3. **Parameter snapshot.** Read every APVTS value into a `BlockParams bp`
   local (`src/dsp/BlockParams.h`). This happens once per block — voice
   rendering never touches APVTS directly.
4. **Modulation targets resolved.** Drift LFO target, ENV 2/3 targets
   (`mod1_target`, `mod2_target`), LFO1/LFO2 targets are all stored as
   integer choices in APVTS; `processBlock` dispatches them onto the
   correct DSP destinations. See §5.
5. **Global LFOs ticked into `lfo1Buffer` / `lfo2Buffer`.**
6. **MIDI routed** through sequencer / arpeggiator / direct note-on.
7. **`voiceManager.renderBlock(...)`** sums polyphonic voices into
   `buffer` with `1/sqrt(N)` scaling.
8. **Post-sum chain.** Global filter → delay → parallel reverb send (via
   `reverbSendBuffer`) → limiter → master gain.
9. **GUI telemetry.** Modulated parameter snapshots (`modulatedValues`),
   `lastMidiNote`, `waveformSnapshot`, `audioIdle` are stored with relaxed
   atomics for the GUI thread to read on its timers.

### `releaseResources`

Resets the master oscillator, sampler, and voice manager.
`src/PluginProcessor.cpp:498`.

### State (`getStateInformation` / `setStateInformation`)

`src/PluginProcessor.cpp:1516` — APVTS state is serialized as XML via JUCE's
`copyXmlToBinary`. On load, transport flags `seq_running` and `gen_seq_running`
are explicitly forced to `0` so sessions never auto-start audio on restore.

Note that this session serialization only captures APVTS. Prompts, seed,
generated audio, axes slot state, and prompt embeddings live outside APVTS
and are persisted separately via the .t5p preset format (§7).

---

## 3. GUI hierarchy

`MainPanel` (`src/gui/MainPanel.h:15`) is the GUI root. `T5ynthEditor`
contains exactly one `MainPanel` member (`src/PluginEditor.h:20`). All
layout is driven by `MainPanel::resized()` — no JUCE `Viewport` or
`ResizableWindow` wrappers.

`MainPanel` owns the major fixed panels as direct members:

| Member                 | Type                     | Source                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `promptPanel`          | `PromptPanel`            | `src/gui/PromptPanel.h:15`       |
| `axesPanel`            | `AxesPanel`              | `src/gui/AxesPanel.h:16`         |
| `synthPanel`           | `SynthPanel`             | `src/gui/SynthPanel.h:14`        |
| `fxPanel`              | `FxPanel`                | `src/gui/FxPanel.h:10`           |
| `sequencerPanel`       | `SequencerPanel`         | `src/gui/SequencerPanel.h:17`    |
| `statusBar`            | `StatusBar`              | `src/gui/StatusBar.h:5`          |
| `dimensionExplorer`    | `DimensionExplorer`      | `src/gui/DimensionExplorer.h:13` |
| `settingsPage`         | `SettingsPage`           | `src/gui/SetupWizard.h:12`       |
| `manualWeb`            | `juce::WebBrowserComponent` | inline in MainPanel           |

### Layout columns

`MainPanel::resized()` divides the window into three columns (generation,
engine/filter/modulation, FX) plus a full-width sequencer row and a top/
bottom status bar. Each panel is a self-contained `juce::Component` that
binds to `T5ynthProcessor::getValueTreeState()` via APVTS attachments. There
is no cross-panel state — panels communicate through APVTS or via
`std::function` callbacks set by `MainPanel` (e.g.
`PromptPanel::onEmbeddingsReady`, `StatusBar::onSavePreset`).

### Overlay panels (Scrim pattern)

Three features render as full-window overlays instead of being inlined:

1. **Dimension Explorer** — launched from the mini preview in
   `MainPanel`. Uses the nested `Scrim` component
   (`src/gui/MainPanel.h:56`) to darken the background and swallow
   click-outside events.
2. **Settings** — `SettingsPage` (the legacy name of the file is
   `SetupWizard.{h,cpp}`; the class is `SettingsPage`). Shows model
   status, Smart Auto-Scan, HuggingFace download buttons, and backend
   connection state.
3. **Manual** — renders `BinaryData::T5ynth_Guide_html` via a JUCE
   `WebBrowserComponent`. The HTML is extracted to a temp file on first
   open (`manualHtmlOnDisk`, `MainPanel.h:94`) because
   `WebBrowserComponent` loads URLs rather than raw HTML strings.

Each overlay has its own `Scrim` member instance and a `visible` flag.

### LookAndFeel

`src/gui/T5ynthLookAndFeel.{h,cpp}` is a single `juce::LookAndFeel_V4`
subclass installed once by `T5ynthEditor`. Shared slider/button/header
primitives live in `src/gui/GuiHelpers.h` (`SliderRow`, `SwitchBox`,
header-bar helpers) — every panel uses these so that spacing, colors and
header treatment stay consistent.

---

## 4. Voice chain

Polyphony is managed by `VoiceManager` (`src/dsp/VoiceManager.h:14`), which
holds a fixed `std::array<SynthVoice, 16>` pool (`MAX_VOICES = 16`) and a
runtime `voiceLimit` from APVTS `voice_count` (choices:
`Mono / 4 / 6 / 8 / 12 / 16`). Policy:

- **Allocation order:** find free voice first, else steal by *oldest note*
  (`noteOnCounter` monotonic, `stealVoice()` at `VoiceManager.h:85`).
- **Equal-power gain scaling:** each voice multiplied by `1/sqrt(N)` where
  `N` = number of active voices, ramped over `GAIN_RAMP_MS = 5ms` on any
  voice count change to prevent clicks.
- **Mono mode** (`voiceLimit == 1`): a single voice with legato glide
  configured via `glideToNote`.

Each `SynthVoice` (`src/dsp/SynthVoice.h:17`) owns its own instance of:

- `WavetableOscillator osc` and `SamplePlayer sampler` (engine mode
  switches between the two; mode is stored in APVTS `engine_mode`, not as
  a class member — see `PluginProcessor::isWavetableMode()` at
  `src/PluginProcessor.h:47`).
- `NoiseGenerator noise` for the sub-oscillator noise source.
- Three `ADSREnvelope`s: `ampEnv` (amplifier/ENV1), `modEnv1` (ENV2),
  `modEnv2` (ENV3).
- Two per-voice `LFO`s (`perVoiceLfo1`, `perVoiceLfo2`) used only when
  the corresponding global LFO is in *Trigger* mode — in *Free* mode the
  global `T5ynthProcessor::lfo1` / `lfo2` values are used instead.
- `T5ynthFilter` (State Variable Filter, `src/dsp/StateVariableFilter.h`).

### Engine data distribution

The oscillator frame data lives once on the *master* instances owned by
`T5ynthProcessor` (`masterOsc`, `masterSampler`,
`src/PluginProcessor.h:122`). After a new generation lands via
`loadGeneratedAudio`, `VoiceManager::distributeSamplerBuffer` and
`distributeWavetableFrames` push pointers/copies to every voice. This keeps
the hot render path lock-free while allowing a single source of truth for
the loaded audio.

### Sub-block filter updates

`SynthVoice::renderBlock` processes audio in chunks of
`SUB_BLOCK_SIZE = 32` samples so filter coefficients can be updated at
sub-block rate without paying the cost of per-sample recomputation
(`src/dsp/SynthVoice.h:49`).

---

## 5. Modulation routing

**Important:** `src/dsp/ModulationMatrix.{h,cpp}` exists in the tree and is
compiled, but it is currently a **stub** — `ModulationMatrix::process()`
does nothing, `getModulationValue()` returns 0. See
`src/dsp/ModulationMatrix.cpp:13`. The planned central routing matrix is
not implemented.

Actual modulation routing today uses a **target-dropdown-per-source**
pattern. Every modulation source has a single `*_target` APVTS choice that
picks its destination at runtime. `processBlock` reads these choices into
`BlockParams`, then in the voice/global mix applies the source to the
selected destination.

Current sources and their target parameters (see
`PluginProcessor.cpp:294-314`):

- `mod1_target` — ENV 2 (Mod 1). Choices:
  `--- / DCA / Filter / Scan / Pitch / Dly Time / Dly FB / Dly Mix / Rev Mix / LFO1 Rate / LFO1 Depth / LFO2 Rate / LFO2 Depth`.
- `mod2_target` — ENV 3 (Mod 2). Same choices as ENV 2.
- `lfo1_target`, `lfo2_target` — Choices:
  `--- / Filter / Scan / Pitch / Dly Time / Dly FB / Dly Mix / Rev Mix / ENV1 Amt / ENV2 Amt / ENV3 Amt`.
- `drift1_target`, `drift2_target`, `drift3_target` — Drift LFO targets
  driving the oscillator generation parameters (Alpha, Noise, Magnitude,
  Axes) and a subset of DSP targets.

### APVTS prefix convention

- `amp_*` — ENV 1 (Amplifier envelope).
- `mod1_*` — ENV 2 (configurable modulation envelope).
- `mod2_*` — ENV 3 (configurable modulation envelope).

ENV 1 is fixed as the amplifier, ENV 2 and ENV 3 are fully assignable.
The naming (`amp_` vs `mod1_`/`mod2_`) preserves the ENV 1 = DCA convention
but all three envelopes use the same `ADSREnvelope` class.

### Ghost indicators

Any slider whose target is currently being modulated paints a small "ghost"
position marker indicating the *modulated* value versus the *set* value.
The audio thread writes the modulated values atomically to
`T5ynthProcessor::modulatedValues` (`src/PluginProcessor.h:212`) with
`NaN` as the "no modulation" sentinel. GUI panels read these on their
timer tick and draw the ghost only when the value is non-NaN. See the
`ModulatedValues` struct definition for the full set of tracked targets.

### Adding a new modulation target

See `docs/ADDING_A_MODULATION_TARGET.md`. In short: add the string to the
relevant `*_target` choice array in `createParameterLayout`, then handle
the new target index in the `processBlock` dispatch and (if it is a
"continuous" target) add a matching atomic to `ModulatedValues`.

---

## 6. Inference IPC

C++ side is `src/inference/PipeInference.{h,cpp}`; the single instance
lives in `T5ynthProcessor::pipeInference` (`src/PluginProcessor.h:144`) and
is launched via `launchPipeInference(const juce::File& backendDir)` called
from the editor on startup.

Python side is `backend/pipe_inference.py`, which is also the entry point
for the PyInstaller bundle. In a release build the PyInstaller one-folder
output at `backend/dist/pipe_inference/pipe_inference` is shipped inside
the plugin bundle; `PipeInference::findBundledBinary` at
`src/inference/PipeInference.cpp:15` searches both that path and sibling
locations inside the app/.vst3/.component resources. In a dev build (no
bundled binary present) the client falls back to invoking
`pipe_inference.py` via a system Python (`PipeInference.cpp:128`).

Key characteristics:

- **Persistent subprocess.** One Python process per plugin instance; it
  stays alive across generations so model-load cost is paid once.
- **Binary protocol** over child stdin/stdout. The platform-specific
  handles are in `PipeInference::`-private members (`stdinFd_` /
  `stdoutFd_` on POSIX, `hChildStdinWr_` / `hChildStdoutRd_` on Windows).
- **Blocking `generate(Request)`.** Called from a JUCE
  `Thread`/`ThreadPoolJob` in `PromptPanel` — not from `processBlock`.
- **Auto-restart.** `generate()` checks `isChildAlive()` and will call
  `tryRestart()` once if the child has died.
- **Startup handshake** exposes the available devices (`mps`, `cuda`,
  `cpu`) and available models; these populate the Settings overlay.

The `Request` struct (`src/inference/PipeInference.h:45`) carries prompts,
alpha/magnitude/noiseSigma, duration, steps, cfgScale, seed,
device/model selection, per-dimension offsets from Dimension Explorer,
and the semantic axes map. The `Result` struct carries the audio buffer,
generation time, final seed, and the two mean-pooled 768-dim T5 prompt
embeddings.

**Wire format details (flag bytes, header layout, error frames) are
documented separately in `docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`.** This file intentionally
does not duplicate the protocol spec.

---

## 7. APVTS parameters and non-APVTS state

### What lives in APVTS

Every real-time audio parameter (oscillator scan, filter cutoff, envelope
stages, LFO rate/depth, modulation targets, delay/reverb mix, sequencer
bpm, step values, arpeggiator mode, master volume, etc.) is declared in
`T5ynthProcessor::createParameterLayout()` at `src/PluginProcessor.cpp:19`.
The layout has grown to ~445 lines and is the single authoritative list;
when in doubt, grep this function for a parameter ID.

Adding a new parameter requires three edits:

1. **`createParameterLayout()`** — register the ID and declare the range.
2. **DSP class that consumes it** — usually add a field to
   `BlockParams.h` and populate it in `processBlock` (and then read in
   the voice / DSP class).
3. **Panel that exposes it** — add a slider/combo and attach it via
   `SliderAttachment` / `ComboBoxAttachment` / `ButtonAttachment`.

### What does NOT live in APVTS

Some state is GUI-visible but does not belong on the audio thread and
cannot easily be encoded as a `juce::RangedAudioParameter`. It lives as
plain members on `T5ynthProcessor` and is serialized only via the .t5p
preset format:

- Prompt text A/B — `setLastPrompts`, `getLastPromptA/B`
  (`src/PluginProcessor.h:68`).
- Last seed — `setLastSeed / getLastSeed` (`PluginProcessor.h:72`).
- Axes panel slot state — `lastAxes[3]` with `{dropdownId, value}`
  (`PluginProcessor.h:76`).
- Prompt embeddings — `lastEmbeddingA`, `lastEmbeddingB` (two 768-float
  vectors, used by DimensionExplorer).
- Generated audio — `generatedAudioFull` (post-HF-boost, for playback +
  display) and `generatedAudioRaw` (unmodified VAE output, for re-apply
  on HF toggle) plus `generatedSampleRate`.
- `lastDevice` / `lastModel` — for preset tagging.

Note that DAW session state (`getStateInformation` /
`setStateInformation`) only captures APVTS, so any of the above that is
needed in a DAW round-trip must be in a preset file or pushed into APVTS.

---

## 8. Binary resources

`CMakeLists.txt:110` calls `juce_add_binary_data(T5ynthData ...)` to bake
runtime assets into the plugin library. Current contents:

- `resources/ir/emt_140_plate_bright.wav`
- `resources/ir/emt_140_plate_medium.wav`
- `resources/ir/emt_140_plate_dark.wav`
- `resources/presets/DEMO T5-Oscillator-Drift.t5p`
- `resources/T5ynth_Guide.html`

These are accessed via the generated `BinaryData::` namespace symbols
(`BinaryData::emt_140_plate_medium_wav`, `::emt_140_plate_medium_wavSize`,
etc.). The convolution reverb loads its default IR this way in
`prepareToPlay` (`src/PluginProcessor.cpp:482`), and the Manual overlay
extracts `T5ynth_Guide_html` to a temp file before pointing
`WebBrowserComponent` at it.

Adding a new binary resource is a CMake-level change: append the source
file path to the `juce_add_binary_data` block and rebuild — the
`BinaryData` sources are regenerated automatically.

---

## 9. Vendored JUCE

`JUCE/` is a full vendored copy of the JUCE framework
(**version 8.0.6** at time of writing, per `JUCE/CHANGE_LIST.md`).
`CMakeLists.txt` pulls it in with a plain `add_subdirectory(JUCE)`
(line 31); there is no JUCE find_package or Projucer layer.

Guidelines:

- **Do not modify JUCE core.** Treat the `JUCE/` tree as a read-only
  third-party checkout. Local fixes to framework bugs should be made
  only if unavoidable, and must be clearly flagged in the commit log
  because they will complicate future JUCE bumps.
- **`JUCE_WEB_BROWSER=1`** is set in `CMakeLists.txt:142`. This is a
  hard requirement for the Manual overlay (`WebBrowserComponent`).
  Disabling it will fail to link.
- **Linux WebBrowser deps.** `CMakeLists.txt:132` explicitly links
  `juce::pkgconfig_JUCE_BROWSER_LINUX_DEPS` because JUCE 8's
  `juce_gui_extra` module does not auto-declare its webkit2gtk/gtk3
  requirements. Without this, Linux builds fail with
  `gtk/gtk.h: No such file or directory`.

---

## 10. Build outputs

The project convention is to build out-of-source in `build_clean/` using
the `Release` config:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build_clean -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build_clean --config Release -j
```

Plugin artefacts are written under
`build_clean/T5ynth_artefacts/Release/`:

- `Standalone/T5ynth.app` — standalone macOS app (the one JUCE builds
  for "Standalone" target; also `.exe` on Windows, binary on Linux)
- `VST3/T5ynth.vst3`
- `AU/T5ynth.component`
- `../JuceLibraryCode/` — intermediate JUCE module compile units
- `../libT5ynth_SharedCode.a` — the shared static archive linked by each
  plugin wrapper

Do not commit `build_clean/`. Do not use alternate build directories —
sibling scripts (distribution, signing, log paths) assume `build_clean/`.

### Python bundle

The PyInstaller output at `backend/dist/pipe_inference/` is produced
separately by running `pyinstaller backend/pipe_inference.spec` from the
`backend/` directory. In CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) this happens
before the C++ build so that the bundle can be copied into the plugin
resources. For local dev, running from a source checkout lets
`PipeInference` fall back to `python pipe_inference.py`, so the
PyInstaller step is optional during iteration.

---

## 11. What is auto-generated

Do not edit these by hand — they are regenerated on every CMake
configure/build:

- **`juceaide`** — JUCE's build helper, compiled once into
  `build_clean/JUCE/extras/Build/juceaide/`.
- **`JuceHeader.h`** — master include umbrella, generated by
  `juce_generate_juce_header(T5ynth)` (`CMakeLists.txt:51`). This is
  the file to `#include <JuceHeader.h>` from; do not include individual
  JUCE module headers directly in T5ynth sources.
- **`BinaryData.{h,cpp}`** — generated by `juce_add_binary_data` from
  the resources listed in §8. Output lands in
  `build_clean/juce_binarydata_T5ynthData/`.
- **`libT5ynthData.a`** — static archive wrapping the binary data, linked
  into the plugin targets via `target_link_libraries(T5ynth PRIVATE T5ynthData)`.

---
