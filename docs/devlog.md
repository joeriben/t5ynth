# T5ynth Development Log

## 2026-04-24 — Polyphonic Generative Sequencer (feature/polyphonic-gen-seq)

Turned the previously mono `T5ynthGenerativeSequencer` into a four-strand polyrhythmic, post-tonal engine. Five atomic commits on a feature branch off main; every phase builds clean as an isolated step.

### Aesthetic framing
User explicitly rejected functional harmony defaults ("keine 1625-Klischees") in favor of Lewis/Coltrane/Satie/serial-music idioms. No chord progressions, no I-IV-V Markov — the polyphony is coupled through a **shared Pitch-Field** (pc-set + center + optional row) that evolves under one of four modes:
- **Static** — Satie-esque modal stasis
- **Drift** (default) — one pc swaps per tick, non-functional glide
- **Transform** — Webern-style row ops (Tn / In / R / RI)
- **Pivot** — Coltrane-matrix shift by pivotInterval (m3 default)

### Architecture (three layers)

1. **Strand struct** holds per-pattern state (Euclidean params, playback clocks, drift counters, Turing degree-walk, fix flags). `strands[MAX_STRANDS=4]` at class level.
2. **PitchField struct** holds shared pc-set + row + evolution-mode state. Advances on strand 0's cycle boundary.
3. **pickNote()** projects a strand's raw Turing-walked scale degree into MIDI via role + metric weighting:
   - **Density role** → `chromaticFieldWalk` (Sheets-of-Sound: ±1 semitone from last note, ignores metric weighting)
   - **Others** → strong beats snap to centerPc with probability = `chordToneDominance`; otherwise `voiceLedFieldMember` picks the field's nearest pc to the raw. Weak beats that fall inside the field keep their raw pc (preserves Turing dynamics).

### processBlock scheduler
Replaced the single-strand `while (samplePos < numSamples)` loop with a multi-strand event scheduler: each iteration finds the earliest upcoming step-boundary-or-gate-off across all enabled strands and processes one event. Each strand runs its own clock at `stepDur / divisionMultiplier`, producing real polymeter (e.g. Anchor ½× alongside Density 2×). Gate-off and note-emission track per-strand `lastPlayedNote` separately; VoiceManager handles concurrent voices naturally.

### APVTS surface
~50 new params across `gen_field_*` (mode, rate, centerPc, pivot-interval), strand-0's new role/octave/div-mult/dominance (`gen_role` etc.), and strands 2–4's full 13-param set (`gen2_*`, `gen3_*`, `gen4_*`). Existing `gen_steps`/`gen_pulses`/… IDs retained — strand 0 still uses them, so old presets load with strand 0's drift/writeback behavior bit-identical for the first ~8 cycles; then the shared pc-set begins to drift (intended).

### UI
Minimal compact addition to `SequencerPanel` visible in GEN mode:
- Row 4: Field-Mode dropdown + Field-Rate slider
- Row 5: three `[ON][Role▾]` clusters for strands 2/3/4

All other per-strand parameters (steps, pulses, rotation, mutation, octave, div-mult, dominance, fix-flags) and the remaining field params (centerPc, pivot-interval) stay at the APVTS level so the panel stays tight. Full per-strand sliders + 4-lane viz were scoped out as a v2 follow-up.

### Commits on `feature/polyphonic-gen-seq`
1. `refactor(sequencer): extract per-strand state into Strand struct` — mechanical
2. `feat(sequencer): pitch field + static/drift/transform/pivot modes`
3. `feat(sequencer): metric weighting + strand roles + sheets-of-sound`
4. `feat(processor): wire polyphonic generative sequencer params`
5. `ui(sequencer): polyphonic strand controls + field block`

### Audio-thread safety
All new code uses stack-local `std::uniform_*_distribution`s, fixed-size `std::array`, atomic stores only with `memory_order_relaxed`. No allocations, no locks, no I/O in `processBlock`. Grep-verified against `new`/`malloc`/`std::cout`/`printf`/`std::mutex`/`std::lock` in the diff.

### Open follow-ups (plan-documented)
- Full 12-slot row editor for Transform mode (v1 only has the auto-seeded ascending row)
- Sheets-of-Sound saturation parameter per Density strand (chromatic bridging density)
- Live MIDI-input → Field-adaptation (Lewis/Voyager-style interactive listening)
- Per-strand pitch-field override (one strand contrasts against the shared field)

## 2026-04-23 — Session 16: Ladder Drive × Resonance ROAR

Resolves the "drive kills resonance" open item from the earlier entry today. The previous tree had a Version C hot-ceiling hack (`hot = kHotCeil · tanh(raw/kHotCeil)`) that was strictly worse than Version B — it killed both the drive harmonics *and* the resonance peak. Reverted it; the fix lives at the per-stage saturation instead.

**Algorithm A — Huovilainen / Surge thermal-voltage normalised stages.** Replace plain `tanh(y)` at each ladder stage with `satStage(x) = 2·Vt · tanh(x / (2·Vt))`. Slope at zero stays 1 (self-oscillation threshold unchanged at `k = 4`), but the per-stage ceiling widens to ±2·Vt. Because `y4` is bounded by that ceiling, so is the feedback tap `k · y4`. With plain tanh (≡ Vt = 0.5) the feedback amplitude was capped at ±4.2 — not enough to swing a first stage pinned at saturation by a 36 dB hot signal through its linear region, so the resonance ring collapsed. Raising to `kVt = 1.22` (canonical Surge value for VintageLadders) gives ±10.2 of feedback swing — the exact headroom that lets the loop oscillate the drive-pinned first stage across zero each cycle. That's the mechanism behind the Minimoog-style ROAR at high drive + high resonance.

Applied to all five per-sample `tanh` calls in `MoogLadderFilter::processSample` (the pre-ladder `tanh(fbIn)` and the four per-stage `tanh(y_i)`). Mirrored into `CutoffWarpFilter`'s Tanh style (`sat(·, 0) → satStage(·)`); other styles (SoftClip / OJD / Sin / Digital / Asym) kept their original curves on this first pass — revisit per-style if the acceptance matrix falls flat for one of them.

**Why not Algorithm B (drive-inside-the-loop) or cytomic/RK4.** Algorithm A is the canonical Huovilainen form used in production plugins (Surge XT, et al.), ~6 lines of change, no coefficient re-derivation, no stability analysis required. B would change the drive topology away from a real Moog (drive is externally applied there, not intra-loop); C and D (Cytomic SVF-physical, RK4+TV) are 4–10× the implementation cost and not obviously needed if A works.

**Level impact.** At low drive the signal doesn't hit `satStage`'s ceiling, so Vt = 1.22 output is indistinguishable from Vt = 0.5 — no regression on the `d0f78364` level parity with the SVF. At 24–36 dB the tap *is* louder by up to ~2.4×, which is the desired "drive makes it louder + crunchier" behaviour, not a bug. The `kTapComp = 1.20` is unchanged; re-tune only if the listen test reveals an audible mid-drive jump.

**Bundled along with the fix** (each its own commit, independently revertable):
- `1178002b` — startup visuals of the filter card's radio rows (TYPE / SLOPE / ALG / OS) now sync directly from APVTS instead of relying on the ComboBoxAttachment's initial `onChange` firing, which some JUCE versions skip with `dontSendNotification`. Fixes the "no active button until you click" first-paint glitch.
- `a021f083` — per-style resonance scaling for `CutoffWarp` (0.65 Sin, 1.35 SoftClip, 1.10 OJD, 1.00 Tanh/Digital/Asym). Each saturation curve has a different DC slope, so a single nominal `k` made Sin ring at r ≈ 0.25 while SoftClip stayed silent at r = 1. Tuned by ear.
- `acba990c` — full problem-statement / acceptance-test handover doc (`docs/handover_session16_filter_drive.md`) so the reasoning is recoverable.
- `5d833f55` — Algorithm A itself.

`kVt` is duplicated verbatim in `MoogLadderFilter.h` and `CutoffWarpFilter.h` (both `1.22f`) with cross-reference notes in both. Deliberately kept each filter self-contained rather than introducing a shared constants header for a single float — if a later change needs more shared state, that's the point to extract.

**Open.** Listen test in progress against the acceptance matrix in handover §8. Expected tuning range for `kVt` if adjustment is needed: 1.0 – 1.5. The preset save/load audit that was listed as open in the earlier entry today was already completed in session 15 (handover §9).

## 2026-04-23 — Nonlinear Filter Algorithms (Huovilainen + Cutoff Warp)

Added two nonlinear filter algorithms alongside the existing linear TPT SVF, selectable via a new Algorithm switchbox in the filter header:

- **Huovilainen-style Moog ladder** (`src/dsp/MoogLadderFilter.h`). 4-pole with `tanh` at each stage input and a half-sample-delay-compensated feedback path (`xPrev` + 50/50 average). The compensation is what makes the classical form actually resonate — without it the loop sees an extra sample of delay and clips instead of ringing. Slope switch taps y1..y4 (6/12/18/24 dB) for the standard Moog multi-mode.
- **Surge-XT-inspired Cutoff Warp** (`src/dsp/CutoffWarpFilter.h`). ZDF 4-pole ladder with a style-switchable per-stage saturation: Tanh / SoftClip / OJD (x/√(1+x²), centered at zero — the initial atan-with-bias version had DC drift that glitched the ZDF loop under modulation) / Sin-fold / Digital clip / Asym (bias-compensated asymmetric tanh).

Credit: Huovilainen 2004 DAFx paper for the Moog algorithm; Surge XT project (GPLv3) for the Cutoff Warp concept. Implementations written from scratch; no reference code copied. Entries added to `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`, `resources/T5ynth_Guide.html`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Drive topology difference.** The SVF uses the existing pre-filter `tanh` (+ optional oversampling) as its saturation character — it's LTI on its own, the drive stage *is* the character. Ladder and Warp have their own nonlinear stages, so the pre-filter `tanh` would flat-clip and leave nothing for the filter to shape. Instead the drive amount is forwarded via `setInputDrive()` as input gain only; Phase B is a no-op for them and the filter's own `tanh`/`sat(·)` stages do the work. No output compensation (`1/inDrive`) — drive makes these filters louder + crunchier like an analog Moog, not level-matched.

**Level parity.** The half-sample input averaging is a `cos(ω/2)` FIR lowpass (−3 dB at sr/4) — required for correct resonance but it pulls Ladder/Warp ~1.5 dB under the SVF on broadband material. Compensated with a fixed 1.20× tap gain.

**Feedback-tap evolution.** First ship had `k·tanh(y4)` (Ladder) and `k·sat(y4, style)` (Warp). Both saturations cap the feedback at ±1, so the loop gain ceiling of 4.2 never translated to an actual resonance peak — the reso slider "controlled something" but didn't ring. Fixed by making the feedback tap linear on `y4` and moving the per-stage saturation to each stage's input (not the feedback tap). Stability still comes from the per-stage sat bounding the internal state.

**Unresolved** (see `docs/handover_session15.md`): Ladder/Warp resonance is still too drive-sensitive — at ~50 % drive on Ladder (and >21 dB on Warp Sin) the resonance collapses entirely because the operating point sits deep in the saturation zone where the local derivative is near zero, killing effective loop gain. Also: the filter-type / algorithm radio buttons occasionally don't reflect their APVTS value on first paint (explicit `onChange()` poke after attachment did not fully fix it); and the preset save/load coverage of all filter-related params still needs an audit.

UI: Algorithm switchbox + Warp Style combo live in the filter header row next to TYPE/SLOPE (Drive slider shortened accordingly). Drive-OS default is 4×; old .t5p files without the new fields load on Algorithm=SVF, Warp Style=Tanh, Drive OS=Off so existing sessions stay bit-identical to pre-Ladder/Warp builds.

## 2026-04-18 — Sampler Wave Cursor Reverted

Tested a live playback cursor in the sampler waveform view and reverted it. On loop-heavy material the 30 Hz smoothed marker felt visually late relative to the audio and was more distracting than helpful. If this is revisited, it should probably use a different visualization approach rather than a lagged dot/cursor over the waveform.

## 2026-04-11 — Installers + Path Architecture

### macOS .pkg Installer
Built with `pkgbuild`/`productbuild`. Four component packages: Standalone (required), VST3, AU, Support Data. The installer creates `/Library/Application Support/T5ynth/presets/` (factory presets, read-only) and `/Library/Application Support/T5ynth/models/` (scan-only). Postinstall removes quarantine flags (`xattr -cr`).

### Windows Inno Setup Installer
`installer/windows/t5ynth.iss`. Standalone + VST3 components, Start Menu entry, uninstaller. Factory presets in `C:\ProgramData\T5ynth\presets\`, models dir in `C:\ProgramData\T5ynth\models\` with `users-modify` ACL.

### Factory / User Preset Split
- Factory presets: `/Library/Application Support/T5ynth/presets/` (macOS), `C:\ProgramData\T5ynth\presets\` (Win) — installed by the installer, read-only for users.
- User presets: `~/Library/Application Support/T5ynth/presets/` (macOS), `%APPDATA%\T5ynth\presets\` (Win) — writable, created on demand.
- `PresetFormat::getFactoryPresetsDirectory()` / `getUserPresetsDirectory()` / `getAllPresetFiles()` added.

### Design Decision: Models Are Per-User
Model download target is always the per-user directory (`~/Library/Application Support/T5ynth/models/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\T5ynth\models\` on Windows). Rationale: model licenses (Stability AI Community License, CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0) are accepted individually per user. Different users on the same machine may have different license status (e.g. commercial vs. non-commercial accounts). The system-wide path (`/Library/Application Support/` / `C:\ProgramData\`) is scanned as a read-only candidate — an admin can pre-deploy models there, but the app never writes to it.

### CI Integration
Both installers are built in CI (`build.yml`), uploaded as artifacts on every push, and included in GitHub Releases on tags. macOS: `build_pkg.sh` in the `macos` job. Windows: `choco install innosetup` + `iscc` in the `windows` job.

## 2026-03-31 — Session 8: Signal Chain Fixes + RT Safety

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Filter never called (CRITICAL):** `SynthVoice::processFilter()` existed with full modulation logic but was never invoked anywhere. Per-voice buffers don't exist (voices are summed sample-by-sample), so a per-voice filter was architecturally impossible without major refactor. **Fix:** Added post-sum `T5ynthFilter postFilter` to `PluginProcessor`, wired between voice rendering and effects chain. Full modulation ported from the dead per-voice code: keyboard tracking (uses newest voice's note), mod envelope → cutoff (subtractive sweep with `1 ± amount × 8` peak/floor), LFO → cutoff (bipolar multiplicative). `hasActiveVoices` guard prevents stale mod values from shifting cutoff when silent.

- **Pitch accumulation (CRITICAL):** `renderSample()` did `osc.setFrequency(osc.getFrequency() * pitchFactor)` — multiplied the *current* frequency by the pitch factor each sample, causing exponential drift to 20kHz in ~100 samples. **Fix:** Added `float baseFrequency` to `SynthVoice`, cached at `noteOn()` and `glideToNote()`. Pitch modulation now uses `osc.setFrequency(baseFrequency * (1 + pitchMod))` — always absolute, never accumulating. Frequency resets cleanly when modulation stops.

### Real-Time Safety

- **Debug FILE* logging removed:** `static FILE* dbgFile` with `fopen`/`fprintf`/`fflush` on audio thread — RT violation + file handle leak. Deleted.
- **LFO buffer heap allocation removed:** `std::vector<float>` was allocated per `processBlock` call. Moved to pre-allocated member vectors resized in `prepareToPlay()`.

### Cleanup

- Renamed `Looper` → `Sampler` throughout (EngineMode enum, GUI buttons, accessor methods, preset import/export). Aligns with actual functionality.
- Added porting comparison CSVs (`docs/portierung_*.csv`) for all composables.

### Correct Signal Flow (after fix)
```
Voices (Osc/Sampler → VCA → sum with 1/sqrt(N))
  → Post-Sum Filter (kbd tracking + env→cutoff + LFO→cutoff)
  → Effects (Delay ‖ Reverb parallel send-bus)
  → Master Volume → Limiter
```

### Known Remaining RT Violations (deferred)
- `T5ynthFilter::processBlock()` allocates `dryBuffer` when mix ∈ (0,1)
- `reverbSrc` buffer allocated when both delay+reverb are enabled simultaneously
- Per-voice `processFilter()` and per-voice `T5ynthFilter filter` are now dead code

---

## 2026-03-29 — Session 6: DSP Bugfixes + LibTorch Migration Start

### DSP Bugfixes (3 remaining from Session 5 audit)
- **modPitch dead code:** Pitch modulation was accumulated in processBlock but never applied. Moved to per-sample in `SynthVoice::renderSample()` where env/LFO values are available. Applies `freq *= (1 + pitchMod)` to wavetable oscillator.
- **barStartFlag unconsumed:** StepSequencer sets flag at bar boundaries but processBlock never read it. Now consumed via `exchange(false)`.
- **DCF idle cutoff drop:** Verified already fixed — `!isIdle()` guard correctly prevents filter modulation when envelope is idle.

### Architecture Decision: LibTorch Migration
- HTTP-based Python backend (Flask + diffusers) is architecturally unacceptable for a standalone audio plugin
- Decision: migrate to LibTorch C++ inference — no Python, no HTTP, no server process
- VRAM properly freed on plugin destructor

### TorchScript Export Progress
- Created `tools/export_to_torchscript.py` — exports Stable Audio components individually
- **T5 Encoder:** Successfully exported (0.00 max diff, 438.9 MB)
- **Projection Model:** Successfully exported (0.00 max diff, 1.6 MB)
- **DiT (Diffusion Transformer):** BLOCKED — diffusers attention processor uses `repeat_interleave` with `output_size` that causes CPU/CUDA device mismatch during tracing
- **VAE Decoder:** Not yet reached (blocked by DiT)

### DiT Export — Next Steps
The fix requires replacing `StableAudioAttnProcessor2_0` with a custom processor that avoids the `output_size` argument in `repeat_interleave`, or patching diffusers locally. Input shapes confirmed: `hidden_states=[1,64,1024]`, `global_hidden_states=[1,1536]`, `encoder_attention_mask` must be bool not long.

## 2026-03-28 — Session 4: Reference Audit + Critical Repairs

### Full Gap Analysis Against Reference (useAudioLooper.ts, useModulation.ts, useEffects.ts, useFilter.ts, useDriftLfo.ts, crossmodal_lab.vue)
- Session 3 left 75% of features unimplemented or broken
- Delay/Reverb/Limiter parameters were defined in APVTS + GUI but **never passed to DSP classes**
- Reverb IR was never loaded — ConvolutionReverb was permanently dead
- Filter modulation double-ticked envelopes/LFOs (ran at 2× speed)
- AudioLooper could only do endless forward loop — missing one-shot, ping-pong, crossfade, normalize, loop brackets, retrigger
- ADSREnvelope used exponential decay (wrong) instead of reference's linear decay, and simple exponential release instead of RC-discharge

### Parameter Wiring (Phase 1)
- `delay.setTime/setFeedback/setMix()` now called in processBlock
- Reverb IR loaded from BinaryData in `prepareToPlay()`, mix wired, IR switching on `reverb_ir` parameter change
- `limiter.setThreshold/setRelease()` wired
- Looper: `loop_mode`, `crossfade_ms`, `normalize` wired

### Correctness Fixes (Phase 2)
- **Double-tick bug**: Filter modulation now uses captured last values from per-sample loop instead of re-calling `processSample()`
- **DCF sweep factor**: 4 → 8 to match reference (`base × (1 + amount × 8)`)
- **Alpha conversion**: UI range (-2..+2) → backend (0..1) via `alpha/2 + 0.5`
- **Fake S&H removed**: LFO waveform list reduced from 5 to 4 (S&H was not in reference, returned silence)
- **Drift LFO 3**: rate/depth/target now wired, `drift3_target` and `drift3_wave` parameters added

### AudioLooper Rewrite (from useAudioLooper.ts)
- LoopMode enum: OneShot, Loop, PingPong
- Loop start/end brackets (fractional 0–1 of buffer)
- Equal-power crossfade baked into buffer (`sin/cos` curves, max half loop length)
- Cross-correlation loop-point optimization (512-sample window, 2000-sample search)
- Palindrome buffer for ping-pong (endpoints not doubled)
- Peak normalization to 0.95
- Retrigger (hard restart from cold-start offset)
- processBlock respects play region, stops on one-shot end

### ADSREnvelope Rewrite (from useModulation.ts)
- Linear attack with soft retrigger (ramps from current level, not zero)
- Linear decay (was exponential RC — wrong curve shape)
- RC-discharge release: `e^(-t/τ)`, `τ = releaseMs/5`, hard-zero at end
- 3ms minimum ramp for all stages
- Loop re-triggers attack from sustain

### Remaining Work (identified in gap analysis, not yet done)
- Filter slope 12/24dB (parameter exists, not implemented)
- Parallel effects chain (currently serial: signal → delay → reverb)
- 13 modulation targets (currently only 4 per source)
- Delay damping filter in feedback loop
- Drift LFO waveform selection (currently sine-only)
- Delay BPM sync
- Sequencer: gate length, glide, note divisions, presets
- Arpeggiator: musical rate divisions instead of float
- UI: on-screen keyboard, preset panel, dimension explorer canvas, loop region display, recording

## 2026-03-28 — Session 3: Audio Pipeline Debugging + Sequencer Fix

### Critical Bug Fixed: No Sound After Generation
- **Root cause**: Looper audio was multiplied by amp envelope, which defaults to 0 without MIDI note-on. Generated audio x 0 = silence.
- **Fix**: Auto-trigger envelopes when `loadGeneratedAudio()` is called.
- **Secondary issue**: SVT filter's `setType()` was called every processBlock, found to not reset state (JUCE source confirms it only sets a variable). Actual filter silence was caused by DryWetMixer behavior — bypassed for fallback sine.
- **Base64 decode**: Original code used `MemoryBlock::fromBase64Encoding()` which is JUCE-proprietary format, NOT RFC 4648. Python's `base64.b64encode()` produces standard base64. Switched to `juce::Base64::convertFromBase64()` which is RFC 4648 compliant.
- **HTTP timeout**: Backend lazy-loads Stable Audio model on first request (10-15s). Client timeout was 5s. Increased to 120s.

### Sequencer MIDI Pipeline
- Implemented `StepSequencer::processBlock()` — sample-accurate 16th-note stepping with MIDI note generation.
- Implemented `Arpeggiator::processBlock()` — 5 modes (Up/Down/UpDown/Random/Order), multi-octave cycling.
- **Critical bug**: `start()` was called every `processBlock`, resetting `samplesUntilNextStep` to 0 each block — sequencer ran at block rate (~86 Hz) instead of BPM. Fixed: only reset on actual start transition.
- Seq and Arp now run **in series** (Seq generates notes, Arp arpeggates them + external MIDI), not mutually exclusive.

### Waveform Display
- `WaveformDisplay::setWaveform()` was never called. Wired via 30Hz timer in SynthPanel polling a snapshot buffer in PluginProcessor. Peak-preserving downsample to 1024 display points.

### GUI Fixes
- Fixed aspect ratio (3:2) — window scales proportionally.
- All ENV/LFO/Filter/Drift sections always visible (dimmed at 30% alpha when inactive) — no collapsing, predictable layout height.
- Font sizes derived from panel's own available height / total content units — everything fits at any size.
- Minimum window: 1050x700.
- Settings page as overlay (auto-scans model at known paths, shows backend status).
- Settings button injected into JUCE standalone header next to Options.
- Master volume as rotary knob.
- MIDI monitor in sequencer panel.
- Seed field as numeric text input with Random toggle.
- Fallback sine oscillator for MIDI testing without generated audio.

### Backend Connection
- `BackendManager` status ("Running") and `BackendConnection::isConnected()` were independent — synced by calling `checkHealth()` when manager reports Running.

---

## 2026-03-26/27 — Sessions 1-2: Foundation + GUI Design Pass

### Project Scaffold
- JUCE standalone + VST3 plugin with full DSP chain (wavetable oscillator, audio looper, 3 ADSR envelopes, 2 LFOs, drift LFOs, SVT filter, delay, convolution reverb, limiter).
- Python backend (Flask) wrapping Stable Audio Open 1.0 via diffusers `StableAudioPipeline`.
- `BackendManager` launches Python server as child process, polls `/health`.
- `BackendConnection` HTTP client on dedicated thread, delivers results via `MessageManager::callAsync`.

### GUI
- 2-column layout: Col1 (25%) Generation (prompts, embedding controls, axes) | Col2 (75%) Engine/Filter/Modulation/Drift.
- Footer: Sequencer + FX (Delay/Reverb) + Master Volume.
- Section colors: Filter=cyan, Modulation=orange, Drift=purple.
- Linear sliders with value display and units (no rotary knobs for parameters).
- Color-coded semantic axes (pink/blue/green) + PCA axes (6 colors).

### DSP
- Full modulation routing in processBlock: envelopes/LFOs → DCA/Filter/Scan targets.
- Filter dry/wet mix via DryWetMixer.
- Envelope looping (re-enters Attack from Sustain).
- Drift LFO re-generation (randomize rate/depth on phase wrap).

### Model Loading
- Local model path support: `~/t5ynth/models/stable-audio-open-1.0/` (symlink to HuggingFace cache or ComfyUI directory).
- Fallback: HuggingFace auto-download.
- Requires HuggingFace pipeline format (`model_index.json`) — single `.safetensors` not usable because embedding manipulation needs separate access to text encoder + projection model.
