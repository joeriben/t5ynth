## 2026-03-28 — Session 4: Reference Audit + Critical Repairs

### Full Gap Analysis Against Reference (useAudioLooper.ts, useModulation.ts, useEffects.ts, useFilter.ts, useDriftLfo.ts, crossmodal_lab.vue)
- Session 3 left 75% of features unimplemented or broken
- Delay/Reverb/Limiter parameters were defined in APVTS + GUI but **never passed to DSP classes**
- Reverb IR was never loaded — ConvolutionReverb was permanently dead
- Filter modulation double-ticked envelopes/LFOs (ran at 2× speed)
- AudioLooper could only do endless forward loop — missing one-shot, ping-pong, crossfade, normalize, loop brackets, retrigger
- ADSREnvelope used exponential decay (wrong) instead of reference's linear decay, and simple exponential release instead of RC-discharge

### Parameter Wiring (Phase 1)
- `delay.setTime/setFeedback/setMix()` now called in processBlock
- Reverb IR loaded from BinaryData in `prepareToPlay()`, mix wired, IR switching on `reverb_ir` parameter change
- `limiter.setThreshold/setRelease()` wired
- Looper: `loop_mode`, `crossfade_ms`, `normalize` wired

### Correctness Fixes (Phase 2)
- **Double-tick bug**: Filter modulation now uses captured last values from per-sample loop instead of re-calling `processSample()`
- **DCF sweep factor**: 4 → 8 to match reference (`base × (1 + amount × 8)`)
- **Alpha conversion**: UI range (-2..+2) → backend (0..1) via `alpha/2 + 0.5`
- **Fake S&H removed**: LFO waveform list reduced from 5 to 4 (S&H was not in reference, returned silence)
- **Drift LFO 3**: rate/depth/target now wired, `drift3_target` and `drift3_wave` parameters added

### AudioLooper Rewrite (from useAudioLooper.ts)
- LoopMode enum: OneShot, Loop, PingPong
- Loop start/end brackets (fractional 0–1 of buffer)
- Equal-power crossfade baked into buffer (`sin/cos` curves, max half loop length)
- Cross-correlation loop-point optimization (512-sample window, 2000-sample search)
- Palindrome buffer for ping-pong (endpoints not doubled)
- Peak normalization to 0.95
- Retrigger (hard restart from cold-start offset)
- processBlock respects play region, stops on one-shot end

### ADSREnvelope Rewrite (from useModulation.ts)
- Linear attack with soft retrigger (ramps from current level, not zero)
- Linear decay (was exponential RC — wrong curve shape)
- RC-discharge release: `e^(-t/τ)`, `τ = releaseMs/5`, hard-zero at end
- 3ms minimum ramp for all stages
- Loop re-triggers attack from sustain

### Remaining Work (identified in gap analysis, not yet done)
- Filter slope 12/24dB (parameter exists, not implemented)
- Parallel effects chain (currently serial: signal → delay → reverb)
- 13 modulation targets (currently only 4 per source)
- Delay damping filter in feedback loop
- Drift LFO waveform selection (currently sine-only)
- Delay BPM sync
- Sequencer: gate length, glide, note divisions, presets
- Arpeggiator: musical rate divisions instead of float
- UI: on-screen keyboard, preset panel, dimension explorer canvas, loop region display, recording

## 2026-03-28 — Session 3: Audio Pipeline Debugging + Sequencer Fix

### Critical Bug Fixed: No Sound After Generation
- **Root cause**: Looper audio was multiplied by amp envelope, which defaults to 0 without MIDI note-on. Generated audio x 0 = silence.
- **Fix**: Auto-trigger envelopes when `loadGeneratedAudio()` is called.
- **Secondary issue**: SVT filter's `setType()` was called every processBlock, found to not reset state (JUCE source confirms it only sets a variable). Actual filter silence was caused by DryWetMixer behavior — bypassed for fallback sine.
- **Base64 decode**: Original code used `MemoryBlock::fromBase64Encoding()` which is JUCE-proprietary format, NOT RFC 4648. Python's `base64.b64encode()` produces standard base64. Switched to `juce::Base64::convertFromBase64()` which is RFC 4648 compliant.
- **HTTP timeout**: Backend lazy-loads Stable Audio model on first request (10-15s). Client timeout was 5s. Increased to 120s.

### Sequencer MIDI Pipeline
- Implemented `StepSequencer::processBlock()` — sample-accurate 16th-note stepping with MIDI note generation.
- Implemented `Arpeggiator::processBlock()` — 5 modes (Up/Down/UpDown/Random/Order), multi-octave cycling.
- **Critical bug**: `start()` was called every `processBlock`, resetting `samplesUntilNextStep` to 0 each block — sequencer ran at block rate (~86 Hz) instead of BPM. Fixed: only reset on actual start transition.
- Seq and Arp now run **in series** (Seq generates notes, Arp arpeggates them + external MIDI), not mutually exclusive.

### Waveform Display
- `WaveformDisplay::setWaveform()` was never called. Wired via 30Hz timer in SynthPanel polling a snapshot buffer in PluginProcessor. Peak-preserving downsample to 1024 display points.

### GUI Fixes
- Fixed aspect ratio (3:2) — window scales proportionally.
- All ENV/LFO/Filter/Drift sections always visible (dimmed at 30% alpha when inactive) — no collapsing, predictable layout height.
- Font sizes derived from panel's own available height / total content units — everything fits at any size.
- Minimum window: 1050x700.
- Settings page as overlay (auto-scans model at known paths, shows backend status).
- Settings button injected into JUCE standalone header next to Options.
- Master volume as rotary knob.
- MIDI monitor in sequencer panel.
- Seed field as numeric text input with Random toggle.
- Fallback sine oscillator for MIDI testing without generated audio.

### Backend Connection
- `BackendManager` status ("Running") and `BackendConnection::isConnected()` were independent — synced by calling `checkHealth()` when manager reports Running.

## 2026-03-26/27 — Sessions 1-2: Foundation + GUI Design Pass

### Project Scaffold
- JUCE standalone + VST3 plugin with full DSP chain (wavetable oscillator, audio looper, 3 ADSR envelopes, 2 LFOs, drift LFOs, SVT filter, delay, convolution reverb, limiter).
- Python backend (Flask) wrapping Stable Audio Open 1.0 via diffusers `StableAudioPipeline`.
- `BackendManager` launches Python server as child process, polls `/health`.
- `BackendConnection` HTTP client on dedicated thread, delivers results via `MessageManager::callAsync`.

### GUI
- 2-column layout: Col1 (25%) Generation (prompts, embedding controls, axes) | Col2 (75%) Engine/Filter/Modulation/Drift.
- Footer: Sequencer + FX (Delay/Reverb) + Master Volume.
- Section colors: Filter=cyan, Modulation=orange, Drift=purple.
- Linear sliders with value display and units (no rotary knobs for parameters).
- Color-coded semantic axes (pink/blue/green) + PCA axes (6 colors).

### DSP
- Full modulation routing in processBlock: envelopes/LFOs → DCA/Filter/Scan targets.
- Filter dry/wet mix via DryWetMixer.
- Envelope looping (re-enters Attack from Sustain).
- Drift LFO re-generation (randomize rate/depth on phase wrap).

### Model Loading
- Local model path support: `~/t5ynth/models/stable-audio-open-1.0/` (symlink to HuggingFace cache or ComfyUI directory).
- Fallback: HuggingFace auto-download.
- Requires HuggingFace pipeline format (`model_index.json`) — single `.safetensors` not usable because embedding manipulation needs separate access to text encoder + projection model.

## Architecture Notes

### Signal Flow
```
MIDI In → Sequencer → Arpeggiator → Note Processing
                                         ↓
              Wavetable Oscillator / Audio Looper / Fallback Sine
                                         ↓
                        Filter (SVT, modulated cutoff)
                                         ↓
                         Delay → Reverb → Master Vol → Limiter → Out
```

### Audio Generation Flow
```
User clicks Generate → PromptPanel builds GenerationRequest
  → BackendConnection POST /api/cross_aesthetic/synth (JSON)
  → Python backend: T5 encode → embedding manipulation → StableAudioPipeline
  → Response: base64-encoded WAV
  → JUCE: Base64 decode → WAV parse → AudioBuffer
  → loadGeneratedAudio(): Looper + Wavetable extract + Waveform snapshot
  → Auto-trigger envelopes → Sound plays immediately
```
