# T5ynth

(note: this description has been written by the co-coding AI, Claude Opus 4.6)


**A text-to-sound synthesizer that navigates the T5 embedding space of a diffusion audio model.**

T5ynth is a JUCE-based synthesizer plugin (Standalone / VST3 / AU) that repurposes Stability AI's [Stable Audio Open](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0) model as an oscillator — not to generate finished music, but to produce raw sonic material for human-nonhuman artistic collaboration.

T5ynth is a personal side-project by Prof. Dr. Benjamin Jörissen, UNESCO Chair in Digital Culture and Arts Education (UCDCAE), Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, and part of the UCDCAE AI Lab Software Collection.

T5ynth is inspired by two research projects:

- AI for Arts Education (AI4ArtsEd, https://kubi-meta.de/ai4artsed), conducted together with the University of Cologne and the German Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Kaiserslautern
- ComeArts Across (https://comearts.uni-due.de/comenets/artsacross/)

(both funded by the Federal Ministry for Education, Family, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMBFSFJ)).

It is dedicated to my dear colleague at the DFKI, musician and AI researcher Dr. Stephan Baumann, without whom AI4ArtsEd would not have come into being.

## Context: Why This Exists

T5ynth emerged from [AI4ArtsEd](https://kubi-meta.de/ai4artsed), a research project investigating alternative, non-standard uses of AI for educational purposes. AI4ArtsEd deliberately subverts consumerist user-subject positions and approaches AI from a critical, empowerment-oriented perspective.

### The Problem with Generative Audio AI

Text-to-audio models like Stable Audio are designed for a specific purpose: generating finished audio content from text prompts. Their intended use case is the substitution of creative labor — type a description, get a result. This positions the user as a consumer of AI output rather than an active creative agent.

### Open Source as Strategy

Stable Audio Open deserves credit: Unlike its commercial siblings which rob artists of their works, it was trained on ~486,000 Creative Commons-licensed recordings from Freesound and the Free Music Archive — not on copyrighted music. Stability AI conducted copyright verification and removed flagged content before training. This is genuinely better practice than much of the industry.

At the same time, "open source" in the AI industry operates as strategic marketing. Releasing a smaller, less capable model (Open) builds community and ecosystem around commercial products (Stable Audio Pro). The openness is real and useful, but it serves a business strategy. We should be honest about this dialectic rather than either dismissing or celebrating it uncritically.

### What T5ynth Does Differently

T5ynth takes this openly released model and implements a non-intended use: instead of generating finished audio, it treats the model's 768-dimensional T5 text embedding space as a navigable sonic terrain. The diffusion model becomes an oscillator — a sound source that a musician shapes, filters, modulates, and sequences like any other synthesizer component.

This inverts the appropriation relationship:

- **Intended use:** Human types prompt → AI produces finished content → Human consumes
- **T5ynth:** Human navigates embedding space → AI produces raw material → Human creates

The generated audio is not the output — it is the starting point. It requires human musicianship, sound design, and compositional decisions to become anything. T5ynth does not make music. It makes material for making music.

Whether this actually succeeds in reframing the human-AI relationship is an open question, not a solved one. That's the research.

## Features

### The T5 Oscillator

The core of T5ynth is a new kind of oscillator that doesn't exist in any conventional synthesizer. Where traditional oscillators generate sound from mathematical waveforms (sine, saw, square) or from recorded samples, the T5 Oscillator generates sound from *meaning*.

The key operation is not prompting — it is **vector manipulation in a learned semantic space**.

Two text prompts (A and B) are each encoded by a T5 language model into 768-dimensional embedding vectors. These are not audio signals — they are points in a high-dimensional space where semantic relationships are encoded as geometric relationships. T5ynth operates on these vectors before any audio is generated:

- **Interpolation and Extrapolation** — A continuous alpha parameter blends between embedding A and B. Crucially, this is not mixing two audio signals — it is moving through the semantic space between two concepts. And the parameter is not clamped to [0, 1]: extrapolation beyond either pole pushes into regions of the embedding space that neither prompt alone would reach, producing sounds that correspond to no text description.
- **Magnitude Control** — The length of the embedding vector can be scaled independently of its direction, controlling how strongly the semantic content influences the diffusion process. Low magnitudes drift toward the model's prior (generic, neutral sounds); high magnitudes push toward more extreme, sometimes unstable sonic territory.
- **Noise Injection** — Gaussian noise can be added to the embedding vector, introducing controlled stochastic variation. This is not audio noise — it is semantic noise, perturbation in meaning-space, producing timbral variations that are semantically adjacent to the original.
- **Semantic Axes** — 8 axes derived from pole prompt pairs (e.g., "tonal sound" vs. "noisy sound") that attempt to define musically meaningful directions in the 768d space. In practice, these axes interact unpredictably with different A/B prompt embeddings — the label "bright/dark" may produce the expected timbral shift for one prompt pair and something entirely unrelated for another. This is a highly explorative feature, not a reliable control surface.
- **Dimension Explorer** — Direct access to all 768 individual T5 dimensions, sorted by activation magnitude. Individual dimensions can be offset before generation. What each dimension "does" sonically is largely opaque — the T5 embedding space was trained for language tasks, not audio, and its internal structure does not map to perceptual audio categories in any documented way. Manipulating dimensions is exploratory and erratic: small changes may do nothing, or they may radically alter the output. This is a research tool for probing the space, not a precision instrument.

The manipulated embedding then conditions a diffusion process (DiT transformer, 20 denoising steps, BrownianTree SDE sampler) followed by VAE decoding to produce 44.1kHz stereo audio.

Two playback modes turn the generated audio into something a synthesizer can work with:

- **Sampler Mode** — Plays back the generated audio with loop points (one-shot, loop, ping-pong) and crossfade. The simpler option — useful for longer textures where the raw character of the generation matters.
- **Wavetable Mode** — Extracts pitch-synchronous single-cycle frames from the audio and builds a scannable wavetable. This turns any generated sound into a pitched, playable oscillator that tracks MIDI notes — the more radical transformation, and where T5ynth starts to feel like a synthesizer rather than a sample player.

### Synthesizer

The point of wrapping a radically unconventional oscillator in a conventional synthesizer is that musicians can actually use it. The T5 Oscillator produces unfamiliar material — the signal chain that follows is deliberately standard so that familiar tools (envelopes, filters, LFOs, sequencing) can be applied to shape it.

- **Signal chain:** ADSR amplitude envelope, 2 modulation envelopes, state-variable filter (LP/HP/BP, 6-24dB), 2 LFOs, 3 drift LFOs (slow parameter wandering), modulation routing
- **Effects:** Delay with feedback/damping, convolution reverb (EMT 140 plate impulse responses by [Greg Hopkins](https://oramics.github.io/sampled/IR/EMT140-Plate/), CC BY), limiter
- **Sequencer & Arpeggiator:** 16-step sequencer with per-step note/velocity/gate/glide, arpeggiator (up/down/updown/random)
- **Presets:** .t5p format stores parameters + generated audio + embeddings — loading a preset does not require regeneration
- **Platforms:** macOS (MPS acceleration on Apple Silicon), Linux (CUDA), CPU fallback

### IPC

The inference runs in a Python subprocess — the BrownianTree SDE sampler (torchsde) is essential for audio quality and not available in C++. Audio transfers to JUCE via a binary pipe protocol (stdin/stdout): JSON request in, binary header + float32 PCM + embedding stats out. No HTTP overhead, subprocess stays alive between generations.

### Preset Format (.t5p)

Presets store everything needed for instant recall: synthesis parameters (JSON), the generated audio (raw float32 PCM), and the 768d embeddings — so loading a preset does not require regeneration. The format auto-detects legacy JSON and XML presets for backwards compatibility.
